= Tea Timer: Another OS X Tea Timer with a ruby twist

A simple tea timer to remind you when your tea is done. Because no one likes cold tea

== Why?

The latest version of Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) broke my favorite little tea timer app (http://www.herwig-henseler.de/teatimer). I've always wanted to play around with Coca so I set out to create a new, Snow Leopard friendly, tea timer

== MacRuby

This project is using MacRuby 0.4 so I can ease into Objective-C
